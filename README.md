# WNM498/699 Generative Art and Code

Description

This collaborative course focuses on Generative Art, Creative Coding, and Implementing emerging technologies. Students will employ industry-standard methods, tools, and workflow to create, design, and animate within the browser and other programming environments. The goal of programming in the course is not implementation or software development but using code as a tool for creative exploration and self-expression. Advanced web tech, workflows, testing, iterations, and implementation will be covered. 

tl;dr You are going to learn to make art using computers.

Grading Policy & Evaluation Procedures

Attendance is mandatory and accounts for a portion of your grade.  Attendance will be taken during class. Simple attendance yields a grade of “Present-C”. Engaging in class discussion, active questioning and inquiry, and diligent note-taking are all examples of student behavior that yields an attendance score of “Present-A”. Being merely present, with behavior such as sleeping, chatting on a social network, texting on an iphone, or tardiness, are all examples of “Present-D” behavior.

For more info, see the handout Grading Policies - Onsite for Students.pdf

Absence on the last day of class is an automatic F grade for the final project. Exceptions can be requested if communicated to the department one week prior to the expected absence. Email newmedia@academyart.edu to request an exception. Two unexcused absences equal roughly one letter grade. Three absences in a row may lead to administrative dismissal. Five absences—excused or not—is an “F” for the Final grade. 
The grade weighting for this course will be as follows:
 
Attendance/Participation 35% 
Assignments 40% 
Final Project 25%

Evaluation of the final project will be graded with a standard rubric divided into three main categories:

Concept
Technical execution (use of software)
Quality of art and design

These categories will be the general framework for how most projects will be evaluated in this course, so it’s good to get familiar with them.


Missed Assignments and Due Dates:

Assignments must be turned in on time and be completed to receive full credit. Assignments turned in on time, even if they are only partially complete, will receive at least 50% credit, so it is very important to turn something in by the deadline. If a student missed a lecture, demo, or class, the homework from that session is still due with the same due date, despite an excused participation absence. Illness must be documented with a note from a doctor. Most importantly, if you feel you are going to be absent, please notify the instructor ahead of time, send an email, or prepare for making up the work and instruction. Every session will distribute a large amount of information and technique, and is designed to build from the session before it.  

Students may submit one late assignment per semester without penalty. That late assignment must be submitted by the end of the following module. For example, if a student misses an assignment in Module 3, they’ll need to submit it before the end of Module 4 to receive credit. 
The final project cannot be submitted late, no exceptions.

Commitment to Original Work

All design work created for this course must be original. Templates, tutorials, stock images, or tracing is considered plagiarism, and the student will be awarded an “F” for that assignment. 
The following exceptions are as follows:

Commercial sound and music may be sampled for your projects and use in this course under “fair-use” doctrine. However, it’s highly advisable to use rights-managed sound and music in your projects when placing them in your portfolio.
